Changelog
=========

0.7.0 (2021-01-11)
------------------

- Changes for Plone 5.2 and Python 3 compatibility.
  Plone 4 should work too, but untested.
  [keul]
- The "Add new user" feature was not working on Plone 5.
  Now it's not based on standard Plone feature anymore due to changes in Plone 5:
  seems that "Add portal member" permission is not used, while the new "Plone Site Setup: Users and Groups" is too powerful.

  So: a new inline form for creating user is provided (very sloppy implementation, but the whole package is Plone 2.5 style, so...).
